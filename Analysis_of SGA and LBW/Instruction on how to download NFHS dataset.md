The DHS do not allow the re-distribution of any DHS micro-level data, either directly or within any tool/dashboard. So I am unable to upload the dataset as the part of this repository. If any researcher needs to reproduce the code, please follow the below step to download the NFHS data from the website. Data may be used only for the purpose of statistical reporting and analysis, and only for the registered research. To use the data for another purpose, a new research project must be registered. All DHS data should be treated as confidential, and no effort should be made to identify any household or individual respondent interviewed in the survey. 

Here are step-by-step instructions on how to download the NFHS dataset from the DHS website:
