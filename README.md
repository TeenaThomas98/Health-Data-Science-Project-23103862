"Estimating and Visualizing Prevalence of Small Vulnerable Babies in India Using Data from a Complex Survey Design: A Secondary Data Analysis of NFHS-5 Data"

# AIM

The aim of this study is to estimate and visualize the prevalence of small vulnerable babies for all 707 districts in India utilizing design based and model-based approaches. The objectives of this research are to estimate the national, state, and district-level prevalence of LBW and SGA in India along with its confidence intervals; to explore the spatial patterns of these conditions across the country; and to enhance the precision of these estimates using the Fay-Herriot model for small area estimation. For this study, I have used both the INTERGROWTH-21st and Gestation-Related Optimal Weight (GROW) standards for SGA estimation.
